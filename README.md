# Nickel2Danmaku
## A project by ThreeNickel Productions

Hi everyone! This repo represents a danmaku style game developed by my Spouse and myself, that we wanted to make open source as a way to share our process with others, and to get feedback, and learn more about game development. 

All of our source and development files, as well as planning documents are included in this directory to let you see how we made everything, and how it all comes together. 


We've made this project using Godot4 as the game engine, so to run the project just open the root folder as a Godot project, and you should be good to go!
