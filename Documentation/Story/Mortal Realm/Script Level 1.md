# Prelude
Start with backlit cat eyes  peering through a van window, it's nighttime and it wakes the residence of the vehicle.  
Shot of outside van, bubbles indicating chibis of the residence show Adrian and Javier discussing how to deal with these pests. 

# Act 1
Bet: Man, at least it's a nice night to go outside.

[intercom]  Glitch: Yeah, you'll have time to enjoy the outside air after you figure out where those damned Witch Kits are coming from. 

Bet: Ah, c'mon. Can't a guy just enjoy the peace and quiet of mother nature?

[intercom] Glitch: Only if ""mother nature"" reminds you that peace and quiet is an amazing time to get ambushed, so keep your guard up!

Bet:  Fine fine, I'm dealin' with the Witch Kits.

[Tutorial: Press and hold Z to fire Bet's Card Attacks,  Arrow Keys for movement and X to release an all-clearing AoE! Crossing the clear line draws lives, powers, and points towards the player.]

# Gameplay
Wave 1: Witch Kits  (WK) Start from opposite ends and gently flutter in vertically, with a timer of 10 seconds initially, then 5 seconds for a total of one minute. They shoot down from the top.

Wave 2: WK Come in from left then right in a conga line of 5, With a .025 sec timer between starting.  They will make one loop before exiting their opposing lane. 20 seconds apart between line start time.  These bullets will vaguely shoot in the last location the player is at upon firing. 
 
Wave 3: Two large WK will come in from the top of the screen and stand stationary, shooting a burst of energy in a circle pattern with a pulse rate of 8 seconds.  After 20 seconds of wave start, some WK will sporadically (about 4 second intervals)  saunter in a zig zag motion towards the bottom of the screen before flying off the nearest  side. They will shoot in a 45 angle.  After 35 seconds the wave will end.

[+.25 Power per Large WK cleared before wave end.]

# Act 2
Bet: I must be getting closer, good thing I don't have any allergies. Their damned fur is everywhere. 

[Off screen box] ??? Don't judge a cat for the way they groom! 

[Misty flies on screen] 

Misty: You wouldn't want someone making fun of how silly you brush your hair, would you?

Bet: Ah, well maybe if my hair caused this much of a mess, it'd be justified.

Misty: Well, if you're looking to get some assistance with grooming, I'm known to give a really close shave. Especially when it comes to trespassers who try to encroach on my line of work.

Bet: Uhm, no thanks I've got a whole look going here...

[Intercom] Glitch: Bet, who is that other voice? Are they related to those damned pests?

Bet: I think I'm gonna need back up.

# Gameplay
Misty's attack patterns are going to be  swift but relatively line based. She'll unsheath her sword and aim for the player's location, landing on a location and slicing her katana. The force will shoot bullets in a somewhat random spray (about 8 bullets per hit). The wind up is about 7 seconds of time, and she'll go until timer depletion (on successful hits) or a max of 30 seconds. 

Misty's first spell card will start with her sword powering up a slash, she will proceed to fire in incremental angles towards the bottom screen, spanning a set of bullets (about 10-15). Those bullets will then travel to opposite sides of the walls, spawning  another 10-15 bullets in interval locations on it's path. These bullets will remain a fixed and die after 4 seconds. She will do this attack until timer depletion (on successful hits) or a max of 15 seconds. 

[Give the player + .5 Power for completing a spell card]

# Mid Cutscene
Misty:  That's it!

Misty's next move will be to begin sending her WK at Javier, increasing in duration until a cutscene takes over, clearing the screen of WK. Introducing new mechanic. 

Glitch: -panting- I hate running. Why did you make me run out here. 

Bet: If you had just come with me at the start of this, you wouldn't have had to run so quickly. Thanks for the help.

Glitch: Tch. So this is going to be more annoying than I previously thought.

Bet: "oh sure, you're welcome Bet. I'm always willing to help you!"

Glitch: Wanna tell us why you're causing problems over here, girlie?

Bet: (And now he's ignoring me...)

Misty: Ooo.. two pretty boys for the price of one. But I really can't be wasting my time fighting here. Better dash~

[Misty Flees, leaving behind several WKs.]

Glitch: Dammit. Fine, guess we're in for a long night. 

[Gain +1 Life]

# Gameplay
Wave 4:  WK  will zig and zag across the screen, shooting bullets in a stream vaguely at last location of the player. After about 15 seconds some more will appear behind the player and shoot bullets in a circle at pulsating intervals for 7 seconds before disappearing. 

Wave 5: One large WK will arrive and shoot bullets out in a pulsating circle for 30 seconds before leaving. Two medium WK will hover in place on either side of the Large WK while shooting smaller pulsating bullets at a .25 speed. They will also leave after 30 seconds.

[Gain +.25 power per Medium WK and +.5 Life for Large WK destroyed before escaping]

# Act 3
Bet: I think the forest is more cat than trees right now.

Glitch: At least we caught up to the culprit. Alright you, fess up, what are you doing?

Misty: Uh-oh, you two are faster than you look. Guess it can't be helped. 

Bet: Wow. That's a lot of cats. I don't think I've ever seen so many in one area...

Glitch: Normally Kits are harmless...but so many of them in one area... a good amount of them look full....

Misty: My babies are definitely getting their fill of souls. Dr. K says we need lots of 'em for the ritual.

Glitch: The ritual...? 

Bet: I dunno who you're pretending we know, lady, but there's no way we can let you keep collectin' all this energy! 

Misty:  Haven't you boys ever heard what happens to curious cats? 

# Gameplay 
Misty's official battle has 3 regular bullet patterns and 2 spell cards.
The regular bullet patterns will include cats zig zagging down and shooting roughly in the direction of the player. She will shoot bullets in a straight line via direction queues of a line, followed by a blast of bullets in a direction.
